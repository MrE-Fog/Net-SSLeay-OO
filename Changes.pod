=head1 WHAT'S NEW IN Net::SSLeay::OO

=head1 RELEASE 0.03, 18 Oct 2011

Change the constructor to the context object so that we can opt
out of the call to "set_defualt_verify_paths".

=head1 RELEASE 0.02, 10 Oct 2009

This release fixes a couple of glaring bugs, and proves that the
module now works even better than before by porting another of the
examples scripts from Net::SSLeay!

In detail:

=item *

F<COPYING.txt> is now included, to dot another legal I

=item *

A few functions which wouldn't have worked in L<Net::SSLeay::OO::SSL>
are now not imported from L<Net::SSLeay>

=item *

One of which would just work if it was exported into the Context
class, see L<Net::SSLeay::OO::Context/set_cert_and_key>.

=item *

The L<Net::SSLeay::OO::Context/accept> and
L<Net::SSLeay::OO::Context/connect> methods now return the
L<Net::SSLeay::OO::SSL> object, as advertised in the docs.

=item *

Work around an OpenSSL bug with client certificates and using
C<set_verify> without passing a callback.

New old example: F<examples/sslecho.pl>
